Traditionally, it is highly valued for its medicinal properties. Its bark, leaves, and flowers have been used in Ayurvedic and folk medicine for their astringent, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. The Mulsari treeâ€™s flowers are often used in skincare and dental care; chewing on its bark and twigs can help in maintaining oral hygiene, reducing gum inflammation, and even relieving tooth pain.

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Mulsari is an evergreen tree that thrives in tropical climates throughout the year, but it has particular flowering and fruiting seasons. Its small, fragrant white flowers typically bloom in the spring and early summer months. The fruit ripens during late summer and is a source of nutrition for birds and wildlife. This extended flowering and fruiting period makes the Mulsari a year-round asset, as it consistently provides fragrance and ecological value. However, it is most admired during its peak flowering period when its aroma permeates the surroundings.</p>

It is commonly found in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plant has also been cultivated in other parts of Southeast Asia and can be found in gardens, parks, and as part of urban landscaping in these regions due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Lifespan: The Mulsari tree is a slow-growing, long-lived species and can live for several decades, often up to 50 years or more under ideal conditions. As it matures, the tree grows to a height of about 10-15 meters, with a dense canopy of dark green leaves. It is highly valued for its durability and ability to adapt to urban and rural landscapes, providing shade and ornamental beauty year after year. Its longevity makes it an excellent choice for sustainable landscaping, as it continues to bloom and produce fruit annually as it ages.</p>
